##Sowing the Seeds of Curiosity
Growing up; my childhood was filled with inquiry about how the world worked. Why did 
people do evil things? How does the Television work? Are the current policies in plac
e the most efficient or most effective? I would ask many questions to my parents, tea
chers, and even to myself. This curiosity is probably why I am extremely interested i
n the scientific world. Although I never got past the hypothesis step with my persona
l inquiries, from physics to biology, the scientific method would be the corner stone
 to carry my curious nature into the future.

##The Freshmen Wall
Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to take a Software Engineer Course in h
igh school and even in my college career it took me a while to consider enrolling in 
one. But finally, in the fall of 2013 I impulsively enrolled in the Introduction to C
omputer Science class and struggled immensely. Every concept, assignment, or syntax h
ad me wondering why I ever took this class, but my curious nature kept wanting to und
erstand more about programming. So, I studied, researched, emailed, and queried until
 I could visualize these new theoretical concepts. 
##Pursuit of Knowledge 
Fast forward a dozen Computer Science courses later, at the time this short essay is 
written, I feel a lot more confident than I did back in ICS 111. I've had a couple of
 part time jobs one dealing with the University network and the other with the Record
s offices database. Both solidifying the concepts learned in my classes, and yet only
 adding heat to my motivation to learn more about technology. What is so intriguing t
o me about technology, especially the software part, is that it is applicable to all 
industries. Everything is being converted to a digital version or being hooked up to 
the network. It is a never-ending struggle to continue to evolve as fast as the techn
ology is, thus making life a continuous journey for Knowledge.
