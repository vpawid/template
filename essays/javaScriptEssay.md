I have encountered the Javascript language before during an internship 
over the summer of 2015. D3 which is a data visualization platform built 
on top of Javascript was one of the technologies I decided was the best 
tool at the time to use. The D3 libraries are very capable, so there was 
no need to create a utility library for my project. Thus, I did not 
invest too much time in reading up on, at the time, the newly published 
ECMAScript 6 specifications.

Since that experience I did not take too much interest into Javascript 
and focused more on the back-end language I was using. Quiet recently I 
have been reintroduced to the Javascript language, specifically the ES6 
edition. Certain things like the for/of loops are very reminiscent of 
python and the dictionary data structure. Another thing I find 
interesting is how Javascript tutorials do not introduce the concept of 
scope when declaring variables. I've only seen var being used in beginner 
tutorials about variable declaration. When using let and const it changes 
the variables from function scoped to block scoped.


Javascript seems to be an increasingly popular language as many 
frameworks for both front-end and back-end Javascript. There is a full 
stack, the MEAN stack, that is programmed from back to front in all 
Javascript. My reintroduction to this language in my software engineer 
course, has been paralleled by the introduction of a new method of 
studying a programming language. The Athletic Software Engineering or ASE 
method utilizes timed exercises called Work Out of the Day or WOD. As 
someone who feels immense pressure when under a time limit it can be very 
stressful. Although the forced repetition and need for efficiency 
encourages students to be competitive and confident before attempting a 
WOD.
